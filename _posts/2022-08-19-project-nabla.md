# Project Nabla: Towards human-like SSBM agents
Using a dataset of tournament players, we can train AIs that can play Super Smash Bros. Melee in a competent and human-like manner.

### General 
Project Nabla trains deep neural networks through techniques known as behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning. At a high level, that means it works in two parts: first, it uses a dataset of Slippi replays from tournament setups, and then it plays against itself to improve.

### Intro
In recent years, game-playing AIs trained using deep reinforcement learning (RL) have found tremendous success, reaching superhuman levels in difficult games such as Go and StarCraft II. Indeed, this project is not the first to apply deep RL to Melee, and I encourage you to check out Vlad Firoui's work on Philip.
