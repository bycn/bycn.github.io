*Pictured: the yellow and red squares are playing a modified "hide and seek". Yellow is the "seeker" who is trying to reach the green square. While they count down in the first half of the game, the red square gets to "hide" by using the brown "boxes" to block the yellow agent from getting there. This complex behavior emerges through a simple zero-sum reward whenever the yellow agent reaches the green square.*
